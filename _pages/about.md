My name is Shuo Xu (许朔). I am a graduate student in the Department of Astronomy at Tsinghua University. And the field my work focus on is galaxy astrophysics. 

I'm interested in many topics of astronomy and astrophysics, such as galaxy-halo connection, galaxy formation, galaxy and halo assembly bias, gravitational lensing.
I'm also have some interest in dark matter model and dark matter detection.


I'm currently working on the simulation data from Illustris and IllustrisTNG simulation. I am exploring the connection between massive halo assembly history and the properties of central galaxies.
