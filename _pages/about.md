My name is Shuo Xu (许朔). I am a graduate student in the Department of Astronomy at Tsinghua University. And the field my work focus on is galactic astrophysics. 

I'm interested in many topics of astronomy and astrophysics, such as galaxy-halo connection, galaxy formation, galaxy and halo assembly bias, gravitational lensing and globular clusters.
I'm also have some interest in dark matter model and dark matter detection, such as axion and ALP detection.


I'm currently working on the simulation data from Illustris and IllustrisTNG simulation. I am testing the performance of different halo mass proxies in the simulation date with different resolution or physical recipe and making a comparison with observation.
