I am Shuo Xu (许朔), a graduate student in the Department of Astronomy at Tsinghua University. And my field focus on galactic astrophysics. 

I'm interested in many topics of astronomy and astrophysics, such as galaxy-halo connection, galaxy formation, galaxy assembly bias and globular clusters.
I'm also have some interest in dark matter model and dark matter detection, such as axion and ALP detection.


I'm currently working on the simulation data from Illustris and IllustrisTNG simulation. I am testing the performance of different halo mass proxy in the simulation date with different resolution or physical recipe.
